# CodeClauseInternship_Color_Detection

Experience the future of visual analysis with our Color Detection Project! Leveraging cutting-edge image processing techniques, this project enables real-time identification and extraction of colors from images and videos.

Using Python and OpenCV, our system employs sophisticated algorithms to detect dominant colors present in the input. The process involves clustering pixels based on color similarity, resulting in the extraction of key color palettes. These palettes offer insights into color distribution, aiding designers, artists, and marketers in making informed decisions about color schemes.

The user-friendly interface allows seamless interaction. Simply upload an image or activate your camera to instantly receive a breakdown of dominant colors along with their corresponding RGB values and proportions. This tool finds applications in diverse fields like fashion, interior design, branding, and image analysis.

Moreover, this project is a valuable learning tool for those exploring computer vision and image processing. The project's open-source nature encourages developers to contribute and enhance the system's capabilities further.

Experience the power of color perception with our Color Detection Project â€” a revolutionary tool that not only enhances visual comprehension but also empowers creative endeavors across industries.
